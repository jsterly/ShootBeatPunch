# ShootBeatPunch
Shoot Beat Punch is a first person shooter where you have to survive until the song's end and fight aliens. Shooting on beat with the music releases a more powerful attack. Off beat increases your burnout bar, once the bar is full, your ipod (weapon) will stop working and you'll need to wait 10 seconds to use it again. You'll be restricted to only punching during this time

NOTE: these are the game files, not the actual packaged game. It is currently unplayable. Please reach out at jsterly@umich.edu if you would like a playable version of the game. 

Shoot Beat Punch is a collaborative effort between Cody Lovelace, Elise Ambriz, Mariah Diaz, Christopher Hill, and Jessica Sterly. We had a 6th member, but that person did not end up contributing much of anything, though he is still listed in the credits. All of our assets and music is listed in the credits page of the game. Aside from a few images, none of the assets used to create the game are ours. We are planning to continue working on the game at this time.
